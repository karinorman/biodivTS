### Introduction

Ecological communities are experiencing unprecedented change as a result of anthropogenic pressures such as climate change, land use change, and invasive species.
Impacts of these pressures are well documented at a global scale by an accelerating global extinction rate [@barnosky2011], and fundamental changes in some of the most well-studied systems (e.g. coral bleaching). At the local scale however, species diversity tells a different story. Recent syntheses of local trends in biodiversity over time have found no net change in local species diversity despite ongoing turnover [@brown2001; @dornelas2014; @vellend2013; @vellend2017] and evidence of a significant shifts in community composition underlying consistent species richness [@brose2016; @gotelli2017] .
<!-- potential indication of biological homogenization due to shifting ranges and/or invasive species--> While communities are clearly changing, our most common species-based approaches do not fully capture the nature of that change.

Functional diversity offers a potentially powerful alternative for detecting and describing community change by providing a mechanistic link between the organisms in a system and the processes they perform [@mcgill2006].
By describing the functional trait space rather than species, functional diversity metrics capture the disproportionate impact of losses or gains of functionally unique species.
Functional diversity metrics are therefore uniquely suited for assessing the implications of community shifts in the full range of species change scenarios.

Beyond simply characterizing changes in community structure, trends in functional composition also have important implications for ecosystem stability, function, and resilience.
There is increasing evidence functional diversity is a better predictor of ecosystem function than species-based metrics [@cadotte2011; @gagic2015], and that different facets of functional diversity play essential roles in maintaining ecosystem stability [@craven2018; @morin2014]. Indeed, almost all hypothesized mechanisms underpinning the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem function are trait-dependent [@hillebrand2009].
Determining functional trends therefore gives a more complete picture of potential trends in critical ecosystem processes.

While functional loss is frequently cited as one of the most pressing concerns of the anthropocene [@cardinale2012; @dirzo2014; @young2016], it is not necessarily inevitable even in scenarios of species loss [@daz2001]. Forecasts of functional loss range from negligible [@gallagher2013] to dire [@petchey2002; @pimiento2020]. And while some observed trends show significant functional loss [@flynn2009] others document no loss even in some of the most heavily impacted communities [@edwards2013; @matuoka2020].
It is therefore critical to establish whether or not functional loss is the general rule for communities, and at what rate functional loss is occurring.

Assessments of broad-scale temporal change in functional diversity have previously been limited by a lack of functional trait data.
<!-- and computational power? --> The majority of work has therefore focused largely on system-specific studies with traits collected in situ.
Ongoing efforts to assemble functional traits for a variety of taxa have made synthesis of existing community assemblage data and functional traits possible for the first time, providing initial insights into the ways functional diversity changes on a broad scale for specific taxa [e.g. fish @trindade-santos2020, birds @jarzyna2016; @barnagaud2017].
<!-- so what do these studies say? does that go here? --> However, to date there has been no cross-taxa assessment of temporal functional change for a broad geographic and taxonomic extent.

Here we perform the first multi-taxa, multi-system assessment of functional diversity change through time.
We assess thousands of mammal, bird, and amphibian functional diversity timeseries to 1) establish a general trend of functional change 2) ???.

### Material and Methods

#### *Data*

We obtained mammal, bird, and amphibian timeseries from the Biotime database, a global repository of high quality community assemblage timeseries.
All studies included in the database follow consistent sampling protocols and represent full assemblages rather than populations of single species [@dornelas2018]. Following best practices for the database [@blowes2019], studies with multiple sample locations were split into individual timeseries following a standardized spatial scale. Scale was set by a global grid with cell size determined based on the sample extent of studies with only a single location [see @dornelas2018] for details on how sample extents were defined), with the area of each cell set to one standard deviation away from the mean of the single extent locations.
All samples from a study within a single cell were considered to be a single timeseries, and species abundances were combined for all samples.

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
tibble(Taxa = c("Mammals", "Birds", "Amphibians"),
       Timeseries_Count = c(48, 2380, 11),
       Species_Count = c(184, 700, 184),
       Trait_Source = c("Elton Traits", "Elton Traits", "Amphibio"),
       Traits = c("body mass, diet, active diel period", "body mass, diet, nocturnality, \nforest foraging strata, pelagic specialist", "habitat, diet, active diel period, \nactivity seasonality, body mass, body length, \nmin maturation size, max maturation size, \nmin offspring size, max offspring size, \nreproductive output, breeding strategy")
) %>%
  mutate_all(linebreak, align = "l") %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "latex", col.names = c("Taxa", "Number of \nTimeseries", "Number of \nSpecies", "Trait Source", "Traits"), escape = FALSE, 
               caption = "Summary of the data in the final trait database.") %>%
  kable_classic() #%>% 
  #kable_styling(latex_options= c("scale_down", "hold_position")) #%>%
   #kableExtra::column_spec(2, width = "5cm") #%>%
  # kableExtra::column_spec(4, width = "10cm")
```

We gathered trait data from the Elton Trait Database [mammals and birds, @wilman2014] and Amphibio [amphibians, @oliveira2017].
These databases include species-level means for traits that best define species' function in the community including body size, diet, and behavioral characteristics.
For the full list of traits included in the analysis for each taxa see Table 1.
<!-- limitations of species level trait data? -->

In order to ensure taxonomic consistency across datasets, Biotime species were paired with trait data based on their species identifier from the Integrated Taxonomic Information System database (citation), obtained through the taxadb R package [@norman2020].
If more than one species in the assemblage data resolved to the same identifier, observations were considered the same species.
For trait data, traits for all species of the same identifier were averaged.
Only studies with at least 75% trait coverage were included and observations for species with no trait data were excluded.
In order to have a sufficient number of species to calculate functional diversity metrics, years with fewer than 5 species observed were also excluded.

Many studies had a variable number of samples within years.
To account for this inconsistency in sampling effort we used sample-based rarefaction by bootstrap resampling within years for each timeseries based on the smallest number of samples in a year for that timeseries.

Our final dataset included 2,443 timeseries from 53 studies in 21 countries and 15 biomes and 13 different traits (Fig 1).
Only four studies (consisting of 11 timeseries) came from Amphibian studies due to the limited availability of amphibian timeseries and low species richness values for assemblages (Table 1).
For a full breakdown of studies and their characteristics, see the supplement.

```

#### *Diversity Metrics*

We calculated yearly metrics of functional and species diversity for each timeseries.
Species-based metrics include species richness (*S*) and Jaccard similarity (*J*) as a measure of turnover.
Jaccard similarity was calculated relative to the first observed year for a timeseries.
A negative trend in *J* would therefore indicate increasing turnover.

Functional diversity metrics were calculated using the *dbFD* function from the *FD* R package.
Here we report functional richness (*FRic*), functional evenness (*FEve*), and functional diveregence (*FDiv*) which together describe three complementary characteristics of the functional space [@mason2005, @hillebrand2009].
*FRic* assesses the volume of the trait space occupied by species in the community, with higher values indicating communities with species of more extreme trait values.
*FEve* describes how species are distributed across the trait space and how abundance is distributed across species.
Higher values of *FEve* indicate more even spacing of species in the trait space and individuals across species.
*FDiv* measures the degree to which species and their abundances maximize differences in the functional space.
Higher values of *FDiv* therefore correspond to communities where many highly abundant species are on the edges of the trait space.
<!-- use these metrics because they're common, not because of their results -->

```{r metric-fi, fig.cap="Example distributions of species and abundance for a single trait axis for high and low values of our measured metrics. Figure is modified from a similar illustration in Hillebrand & Matthiessen 2009.", echo=FALSE, strip.white=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/conceptual_fig.jpeg"))
```

All available trait data for each study were included in functional diversity calculations with the exception of traits that were the same value for all observed species in the study.
All continuous traits were z-score scaled to give each trait equal weight in the trait space [@leps2006; @schleuter2010].
The number of trait axes was limited to the maximum number of traits that fulfills the criteria $s >= s^t$, where $s$ is the number of species and \$t\$ is the number of traits.
This restriction allows for a sufficient number of axes to capture the trait space while maintaining computational feasibility.
Metrics incorporated weighting based on species abundance where available.

#### *Null Models*

We corrected for bias in functional diversity metrics due to changes in species richness by calculating the standardized effect size (SES) for each metric from null estimates [@swenson2012]. Null model corrections allow us to assess the degree to which the observed functional diversity metric deviates from the value expected by chance in a randomly assembled community. Null estimates were calculated for each rarefied sample by randomly sampling species from the species pool for each year and randomly assigning observed abundances to species. Species pools included all species observed for a timeseries. This process was repeated 500 times to get an estimate and standard deviation of the null expectation for the metric for that timeseries. We used these values to calculate SES using the following formula: $SES = [F_{obs} - mean_{(F_{null})}]/SD_{(F_{null})}$.
Unless otherwise specified, functional diversity results are reported for standardized values for the remainder of the paper.

<!-- description of edge case where community = species pool -->

#### *Analysis*

We estimated general trends for each diversity metric using a Linear Mixed Effects model with a random slope and intercept for each timeseries nested within the study.
To test for differences in trends by taxa, biome, and realm, each variable was modeled individually as random effects in models of the same structure.
We obtained study-level estimates of temporal change from the Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUPs) for each overall trend model with no additional covariates.

We assessed the impact of timeseries duration and start year on study-level trends using General Linear Models with duration and start year as predictors.

```

### Results

We found no significant overall trend in species richness or functional diversity metrics (Fig 2).
There was also no temporal trend in those metrics for studies broken down by taxa, biome or realm.
We did find a significant overall decrease in Jaccard similarity, indicating increasing turnover through time.
Non-significant overall trends indicate that an equal number of studies experienced increasing and decreasing trends in those metrics.

At the study level, only 7 of 54 studies experienced a significant trend for a metric other than Jaccard similarity.
4 studies had a significant trend in species diversity, one positive and three negative.
Two studies experienced a significant decrease in functional evenness, and one study experienced a significant decrease in both functional richness and functional divergence.

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

data.frame(sign = c("+", "-"), S = c("1", "3"), `Jaccard Similarity` = c("0", "37"), FRic = c("0", "1"), FEve = c("0", "2"), FDiv = c("0", "1")) %>%
  column_to_rownames("sign") %>%
  kable(caption = "Number of studies that experienced a signficiant trend in each calculated metric.")
```

Trends for multiple metrics were significantly related to the the sampling characteristics of indivdual studies.

<!-- the majority of studies (86%) experienced a significant temporal change in species richness and all functional diversity metrics. 92% of studies experienced a significant trend for species richness, 88% for functional richness, 98% for functional divergence, 96% for functional evenness, and 30% for Jaccard similarity. Only 4 (cite studies) out of 53 studies experienced no significant trend in species richness and were also characterized by significantly decreasing functional evenness. There was only one significant pairwise correlation between the metrics, a positive relationship between Functional Divergence and Functional Evenness, indicating that communities experiencing an increase in Divergence frequently experience an increase in Evenness. -->

<!-- Cluster analysis grouped all but a few studies into a cluster characterized by non-significant or very small significant slopes for all metrics. We identified four other clusters containing six studies (list studies) that were characterized by outlier trends in at least one of the metrics and near-zero trends in the rest. The first contained two studies with the most strongly decreasing evenness. The second, two studies with the most strongly increasing functional divergence and increasing functional richness. The third contained one study with strongly decreasing functional divergence and richness, and the fourth strongly decreasing species richness with increasing functional richness. -->

### Discussion

Our study represents the largest broad-scale multi-taxa assessment of functional change through time to date, giving a first look at aggregate and local trends in functional diversity in mammal, bird, and amphibian communities.
Surprisingly, we did not detect an overall trend in any of the calculated functional diversity metrics.
As with previous species-based syntheses, we also found no overall trend in species diversity accompanied by increasing turnover through time [@dornelas2018], indicating that non-significant trends in functional metrics may be consistent with similar well-documented species derived trends.
We found no evidence of systemic functional richness loss or functional change.
A lack of trend for data broken down by realm, biome, and taxonomic group gives further evidence that directional functional change is absent from all systems observed in our dataset.

Communities demonstrated almost universal maintenance of functional composition.
While the majority of the studies (\~70%) included in our data experienced significant species turnover, only three experienced a significant shift in any functional dimension.
This suggests certain characteristics of the functional space are conserved even in the face of significant change in species identity, namely the size of the functional space occupied by the community (FRic) and the distribution of species and individuals within that space (FEve and FDiv).
On average, species additions have similar functional characteristics as lost species and therefore maintain the functional space structure.
<!-- language to distinguish between "functional traits" and a species' role in the context of the functional space -->

-   Paragraph about analog communities?

-   Paragraph about implications for BEF work

Our work challenges assumptions that functional loss is the default state of all or even many communities.
While we do not directly assess the disturbance histories of included communities, many are from sites that experienced significant disturbance or manual treatment (see appendix for metadata of included studies).
<!-- check this, get numbers? --> This is good news for ecosystem function!
But we may also be measuring the wrong dimensions of the trait space or the wrong traits.
Can't really say BEF needs to measure function directly because these communities aren't losing species or functional diversity - turnover is either within regular bounds or if not (if more turnover than normal) it's still maintaining community structure.
And presuming that the original structure was good for function, maintaining it is also good for function!

**What are we going to say about the disturbance/environmental change backgrounds of these communities??**

While we did not directly assess the impact of potential disturbance or environmental change in the included communities

While there are clear impacts on functional makeup in scenarios of disturbance (what other scenarios do we see??)

-   some of these studies expereience a disturbance/treatment!

-   even for those that didn't it is remarkable that these metrics were conserved so universally!

    The overall trend of increasing turnover is consistent with work indicating higher than expected background rates of turnover in contemporary communities [@gotelli2017; @magurran2018].

[@osullivan2021]

<!-- Link turnover paragraph to background turnover rate, maintenence of species diversity (i.e. turnover is happening! what does that mean for speices div? maintained. for functional diversity? maintained.) -->

<!-- Here's the prediction of the field, here is the data of the field, given that the data doesn't match the prediction it's on the field to resolve these issues. -->

*Implications for Future Work*

Despite widespread concern about the loss of functional diversity, our analysis does not indicate significant change in functional composition is the rule for communities.
Why

This study represents the best available biodiversity and trait data paired with best practices in biodiversity synthesis.
Why then do we find no change despite extensive predictions to the contrary from both **theory** <!-- need more theory in the intro? --> and and many local studies?
First, the Biotime database is not a representative sample of the world's biodiversity or areas of greatest threat [@gonzalez2016; @vellend2017] (other sampling citation!), and the subset of data in this study exhibits a strong Northern Hemisphere bias.
We may simply not have data from those areas experiencing the greatest functional shifts.
We do however emphasize that even disturbed sites can maintain structure (citation), and therefore the inclusion of these sites would not necessarily change the result.

You'd imagine the pattern would still be visible even with North American birds...

Second, despite using the most comprehensive trait databases for these taxa, we were still limited to species-level means of the traits deemed important by database creators.
The importance of intraspecific variation is well documented [@desroches2018; @violle2012], however individual-level traits are rarely collected along side monitoring data, especially for the longest running efforts.
Further investment in individual level trait data for long-term monitoring will be critical for assessing finer scale shifts that likely occur more commonly in communities and potentially preceded bigger changes.

Third, while we use here the most common metrics for describing functional diversity there are a number of possible metrics for assessing a functional space, with new ones frequently proposed.
There may be a significant shift in a characteristic of the functional space that was poorly captured by our chosen metrics.
<!-- Further exploration of complementarity of traits... -->

Notably, the metrics we calculated do not capture shifts in the location of the functional space.
For example two communities could have very similar metric values but no overlap in their trait spaces.
This is especially critical in the context of biodiversity change, as a species could be lost and replaced by a species with very different functional attributes, but the replacement would go undetected if the new species expanded the trait space by the same degree and had similar population attributes.
This may be particularly relevant for communties that exist in a rapidly changing envrionment (both abiotic and biotic), as communities may maintain some characteristcs of their functional composition while shifting to track the new conditions.
Metrics developed to assess shifts and overlaps in trait spaces are now being developed (citation), and further exploration of time series using those approaches may disentangle maintained characteristics from occupied trait space.

-   one opening sentence that links back to the null result

Even with the right data and metrics, you may not see a result!
Due to the wide variety of mechanisms at play we amy not expect to see a global trend even when the local trends are significant.

Our results highlight a gap in both empirical and theoretical work linking shifts in community composition to functional change.
While a large body of work assesses study-level insights into temporal functional responses (citations), a macroecological perspective illustrates the urgent need for future work exploring the factors important in determining functional change under different species change scenarios.
Due to the many previously discussed barriers to directly assessing functional shifts, a framework for predicting functional change from community characteristics would be a substantial step forward in understanding biodiversity change.

Much of the work linking species change (or loss) to ecological process either implicitly or explicitly assumes functional loss follows from species loss in natural communities.
For example ....
This assumption is clearly refuted by our results.

Our results have important implications for how we approach work linking species loss to ecosystem processes, which often implicitly assume concurrent functional loss.
There is no evidence of directional functional loss or even functional shifts accompany species loss in these natural communities.
<!-- clarify that this is about relationship between concurrent patterns in a single community --> Building on a rich body of work linking species diversity changes to changes in ecosystem function, resilience, and stability (citations), it will be essential to tease apart effects due to species change from those due to functional shifts if we want to infer impacts in natural communities.

We can not understand all functional loss in terms of species loss

-   lean in to four points in the abstraction

    -   raises questions for future data collection and theoretical development

-   field that's full of idle speculation

-   find papers that make claims we're "testing"

<!-- call for theory development, punt back to community ecology - we don't know what this means! -->

Our results emphasize the importance of directly assessing functional change rather than assuming functional loss accompanies species loss.

-   getting functional data is costly, so we'd like to be able to say something about udnerlying functional composition without it

-   list of studies where they make functional inference without only species level data

Also illustrates the lack of theoretical development surrounding the relationship between functional and species change, and when you would expect different kinds of relationships.

-   also theory around the implications of functional shifts for ecological processes

**Notes**

<!-- The absence of systematic loss of functional richness or functional divergence suggests that widespread biological homogenization is not occurring in sampled communities. Biological homogenization occurs when endemic or rare species are lost and replaced with generalist or non-native species, resulting in a loss of -->

As the first broad scale analysis of temporal functional diversity change we make x broad conclusions.
First,

Above all our study shows that patterns of functional change can not be inferred from

-   how are these findings consistent with expectations for hypothesized shifts in functional change?

-   Biological homogenization is one of the hypothesized meaningful forces

-   other unmeasured taxa may be harder hit?
    different patterns for fish assemblages

-   contextualize functional shifts in other temporal studies

While species-level metrics are the only functional data available to perform an analysis of this scale, they are unable to detect functional shifts in communities with little to no turnover as they do not capture intraspecific shifts.

Data limitations:

-   species-level traits

-   not a lot of changes in these systems already?

-   lean into it as a conclusion

-   we found a null result and its your fault

-   fixing x, y, z could resolve the null result, but there are good reasons it might not

-   talk about balance of local trends as the fourth reason

There are reasons we haven't got trait data, hoped there would be an easy way out, but these results show that there isn't

Is there a null result for some deep theoretical reason or

we could've been lucky that we would see the pattern with crappy data, but it isn't
