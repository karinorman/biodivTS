### Introduction

Change is a fundamental process shaping ecological communities across
the globe. Natural background rates of change are also now punctated by
shifts as a result of anthropogenic pressures such as climate change,
land use change, and invasive species. One of the most widely accepted
phenomena characterizing the world's ecological communities is that of
change.

Ecological communities are experiencing unprecedented change as a result
of anthropogenic pressures such as climate change, land use change, and
invasive species. Impacts of these pressures are well documented in an
accelerating global extinction rate (citation), shifts in the nature of
well studied systems (natural history sense, e.g. forests (FIA), coral
bleaching?), increasing fragmentation etc (how do we know things are
bad??). Despite all this, a developing body of work indicates that one
of the most ubiquitous metrics of an local-scale ecosystem, the number
of species, does not show a clear global decline. How do we reconcile
documented change in communities with this finding? We assess/make the
case for/present a powerful alternative approach to understanding
biodiveristy change through a functional lens by assess functional
change through time for mammal, bird, and amphibian communities across
the globe.

The number of species (species richness) is the defualt approach for
measuring community structure, especially in studies comparing trends
across many assemblages of different types.

#### Paragraph 1 - communities are changing, we need to know how and what that means for ecosystem properties

-   communities are changing as a result of a whole bunch of different
    pressures

-   a few well documented phenomena: accelerating extinction rates, what
    else?

-   it's essential for conservation and ecology to understand what these
    changes mean for ecosystem properties like stability, function, etc

#### Paragraph 2 - species diversity is the go to - it's not working

-   traditionally the most common method of capturing change in
    communities is biodiversity

-   despite other well documented changes, species diversity doesn't
    seem to capture local community-level changes
    ([@dornelasAssemblageTimeSeries2014],
    [@suppSpecieslevelCommunitylevelResponses2014],
    [@vellendGlobalMetaanalysisReveals2013]), though there is evidence
    of a significant increase in turnover

-   We need to look beyond species and their abundances to understand
    the kinds of changes happening in communities

#### Paragraph 3 - functional diversity is the answer!

-   Functional diversity provides a potentially powerful tool for
    examining biodiversity changes because it captures characteristics
    beyond species identity.

-   Powerful functional lens ([@mcgillRebuildingCommunityEcology2006])

-   Functional diversity can tells us a story independent of species
    richness, as huge functional changes can occur while species
    richness (or even diversity!) stays the same. This especially gives
    insight into the turnover we know is occurring

-   We examine 100's of mammal, bird, and amphibian timeseries from the
    Biotime database paired with functional trait data to assess overall
    trends in functional change and identify where functional diversity
    tells us a story beyond species richness

### Methods

#### *Data*

Biodiversity timeseries were obtained from the Biotime database, a
global repository of assemblage timeseries with 386 individual studies
from multiple taxa. Following best practices for the dataset
[@blowes2019] to account for differences in scale between studies, we
aggregated based on a grid system:

*annotation of* `01_biotime_grid.R`

-   label single location (SL) or multiple location (ML), ML with an
    extent less than ((SL extent mean + SL extent SD) are assigned to be
    SL

    -   SL coords are the central lat and long, ML coords are the center
        of convex hull of locations within a rarefyID (grid cell)

-   exclude studies with one year of data

-   create global grid with resolution based on the cutoff study area
    size (SL extent mean + SL extent SD)

-   collate observations for the same study within cells/years

-   remove years (for count) or rarefyID's (for abundance and biomass)
    that do not meet coverage requirement of

Timeseries were paired with their functional trait data based on the
predominant taxa in the timeseries. Due to limitations in trait data and
processing feasability, we included only mammal, bird, and amphibian
timeseries. Trait data were obtained from Elton Trait Database (mammals
and birds; [@wilman2014]) and Amphibio (amphibians, [@oliveira2017]).

-   something here describing where the data in those databases comes
    from, that they're species-level means, etc**;**

-   also more description of how biotime is structured (studies, some
    with plots, etc)

In order to ensure taxonomic consistency across datasets, biotime
species were paired with trait data based on their species identifier
from the Integrated Taxonomic Information System database (citation),
obtained through the taxadb R package
([@normanTaxadbHighperformanceLocal2020]). If more than one species in
the assemblage data resolved to the same identifier, observations were
considered the same species. For trait data, traits for all species of
the same identifier were averaged. Only studies with at least 85% trait
coverage were included. In order to have a sufficient number of
observation years to observe a trend and a sufficient number of species
to calculate functional diversity metrics, studies with fewer than 4
years and years with fewer than 4 species observed were also excluded.

Functional diversity metrics were calculated for total yearly abundance.
For many studies there were a different number of samples within each
year. To adjust for this inconsistency in sampling effort we used
sample-based rarefaction by bootstrap resampling within year for each
timeseries based on the smallest number of samples in a year for that
timeseries.

-   raw abundance counts within a year for each plot

#### *Functional diversity metrics*

We calculated yearly metrics of functional diversity and turnover for
each plot within each study. All available trait data for each study was
included in the trait matrix with the exception of traits that were the
same value for all observed species in the study. All continuous traits
were z-score scaled to give each trait equal weight in the trait space
([@lepsQuantifyingInterpretingFunctional2006],
[@schleuterUserGuideFunctional2010]).

We used the function dbFD from the FD package (citation) to calculated
PCA-scaled trait matrices for each species in a timeseries and
functional diversity (FD), functional evenness (FEve), functional
diveregence (FDiv), and functional dispersion (FDis) based on those
trait matrices. The number of trait axes was limited to the maximum
number of traits that fulfills the criteria $s >= s^t$, where $s$ is the
number of species and \$t\$ is the number of traits. This limitation
allows for a sufficient number of axes to capture the trait space while
maintaining computational feasibility for metric calculations. Metrics
incorporated weighting based on either species abundance or biomass
based on the methods for each study. The PCA-scaled trait matrices were
then used as input to the BAT package....

-   needed euclidian distance matrix - used calliez correction because
    it was a sufficient correction for all plots even though it led to a
    marginal decrease in "quality" for the corrected hull

-   null model stuff via [@swensonBiogeographyFilteringWoody2012] - for
    years where all species in the species pool were observed the null
    model sd is zero for functional richness, since FRic does not
    incorporate abundance changes. - drop species with trait match
