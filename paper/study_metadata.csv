West Thornton. Grafton County. New Hampshire. USA. Our study took place on the 10-ha forest plot de- scribed by Holmes and Sturges (1975). which is located on a relatively steep (20-25%). south-southeast facing slope at an elevation of 500 to 600 m and adjacent to the lower third of watershed 6. the reference area for many of the Hubbard Brook ecosystem studies. The study plot was situated within a large tract of unfrag- mented and relatively homogeneous northern hard- woods forest. > 5 km distant from. and at an elevation 300 m above. the nearest human settlement. The only human-caused disturbances near the study area were on three experimental watersheds. 13. 10. and 22 ha in extent. which were logged by clear-cutting in 1967. in 1970. and from 1973 to 1975. respectively. The nearest of these was 0.6 km from the edge of our plot. the others were 1 and 2 km away. Although some for- est-dwelling birds moved to these areas in mid and late summer to feed on ripening fruit. we have no evidence that birds settling and breeding on the study area were in any way affected by these logged areas.Bird populations Bird censuses were conducted in a consistent manner in each of the 16 summers. These census methods have been described in detail by Holmes and Sturges (1975). Briefly. they involved: (1) Timed censuses. Two ob- servers moved at a rate of 50 m/6 min along parallel transect lines. 1 00 m apart. and recorded all birds heard or seen within 50 m on either side of the line. Since the 10-ha plot was 500 m long and 200 m wide and these lines ran 50 m in from the long sides. the entire plot was surveyed in a 1-h census. From these records. the numbers of individuals observed on the plot were then tallied. A minimum of two such censuses was conducted each week from late May through mid-July. (2) Territory-mapping. The positions of individual males (and females when seen). especially those en- gaged in simultaneous singing with neighbors. were plotted on a gridded census map. From these records. the territories of the males of many species could be delineated. (3) Mist-net captures. Forty to 50 mist nets. located at 50-m intervals on the census grid. were op- erated for 6-8 h/d. usually 1 or 2 d/wk from late May through early July in all years except 1980. Each cap- tured bird was given an aluminum band plus a unique combination of colored plastic bands. Capture and re- capture frequencies provided additional information on the presence of birds on the plot. including females and occasionally floaters. (4) Detailed observations. These provided information on nesting events and on the occurrence of females associated with males. Data from all methods were pooled and used to es- timate the total numbers of adult birds of each species living on the 1 0-ha study area during the breeding pe- riod. late May to early July. Final density estimates were adjusted for territories occurring only partly on the plot (i.e.. if a territory of a mated pair was half off the study area. only 0.5 male and 0.5 female for a total of one bird was counted) and for unmated males. The data therefore represent the total numbers of adult in- dividuals occupying 10 ha of northern hardwoods. For comparisons with most other studies. the numbers of individuals estimated to be on our plot should be di- vided in half to approximate the numbers of breeding pairs. These methods were most efficient for estimating the numbers of relatively small. mostly passerine birds that inhabit these forests. but also most woodpeckers and the one hummingbird species (see Table 2). We were unable to census adequately the raptors (Red-tailed Hawk. Buteo jamaicensis; Broad-winged Hawk. B. platypterus; Sharp-shinned Hawk. Accipiterstriatus; and Barred Owl. Strix varia). Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa um- bellus). Chimney Swift (Chaetura pelagica). and Pi- leated Woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus). which were present in this forest but ranged over an area much larger than our 10-ha plot. These low-density species are not included in our analyses. Insect Sampling We used two methods to estimate the abundance of larval Lepidoptera (caterpillars). First. during periods of relatively high caterpillar densities (specifically sum- mers 1969 through 1973). we collected their fecal pel- lets (frass) falling from the forest canopy. Following the procedures of Gosz et al. (1973). we placed 20 funnels (each 20 cm in diameter) lined with filter paper and attached to 1 m tall stakes in a rectangular array on the census plot. with adjacent funnels 100 m apart. Frass was collected from the funnels at 2-4 d intervals. dried at 70'C for 48 h. and then weighed. Second. in 10 summers. caterpillars were censused directly on foliage by visually searching at least 80 50- leaf samples (i.e.. 4000 leaves and supporting petioles and twigs) at z2-wk intervals. For this paper. only data from caterpillar counts on beech foliage in the forest understory are presented. because (1) it was cen- sused in more seasons than any other type of foliage. (2) caterpillar abundance there was representative of that occurring on the foliage of other forest trees (R. T. Holmes and J. C. Schultz. personal observation). and analyses of the vertical distribution of caterpillars in this forest showed few if any differences in their abundance among the canopy. subcanopy. and sapling strata (J. C. Schultz and R. T. Holmes. personal ob- servation). Foliage profile measurements For recording changes in the vertical distribution of foliage. we measured the foliage density profile. using the method of MacArthur and Horn (1969). Six sep- arate vertical transects were made along a randomly placed sample line at each of 20 sites located 100 m apart on the study area. The measurements were av- eraged for each site. and then means and standard de- viations of foliage densities at each of seven vertical strata were obtained for the plot as a whole. Data were taken on the plot in 1972-1973 and again in 1982 at the same locations. Student's t tests were used to detect differences in foliage density within each stratum be- tween sampling periods.

Lockley. He took a lease on the island in October1927. and kept records of breeding birds from 1928 to1940 (Lockley 1938. 1947). After the war theobservatory was run by the West Wales Field Societyand the Council for the Promotion of Field Studies (nowthe Field Studies Council). and later by the EdwardGrey Institute of Field Ornithology of the University ofOxford. Records of breeding and. for most species inmost years. counts or estimates of the numbers ofbreeding pairs are available from 1928 to 1979. with abreak from 1941 to 1945. making 47 years of records.Those up to 1967 have been published by Lack (1969)and analysed by Williamson (1981). Those since 1967have been extracted from the Annual Reports of theObservatory in the Alexander Library of the EdwardGrey Institute. The whole record for land and waterbirds is given in Tab. 1.The criterion for inclusion in Tab. 1 is breeding. butas is now well recognised. there are different degrees ofcertainty in such records. For a study of immigrationand extinction the important question is whether a pairof birds was attempting to breed. rather than whether itbred successfully. For instance the raven Corvus coraxhad one pair every year (two in 1961). but in 1978built a nest in Steep Bay. but it remained empty. Inthe British Trust for Ornithology code this is B. Nestbuilding. and counts only as Probable breeding in thisspecies. though it is regarded as Confirmed breedingin most others (Sharrock 1976). For this study it countsas a population of one pair. In most cases the annualreport gives a single figure for the number of pairs. Forneighbouring integers. e.g. 12 or 13. I have taken thehigher figure. for ranges. e.g. 35 to 40. a figure at or just slightly from Lack (1969). and includes figures thatabove the mid-point (38 in this case). Lack records as question marks. and Lockley also givesFor the pre-war figures Lockley (1947) differs the figures for 1940. I have therefore taken histhroughout. rather than Lack's. The only importantdifference in relation to the MacArthur-Wilson theoryis that Lockley records one pair of sky lark Alauda arvensisin 1938. which Lack (and Williamson 1981) recordas an extinction followed by an immigration in1939. Lockley also notes that he shot or deported littleowls Athene noctua when he could. because they atestorm petrels Hydrobates pelagicus. so I have excludedlittle owls from Tab. 1.It is evident that many of the estimates of the commonbirds in Tab. 1 are round figures. In some yearsestimates are lacking. though breeding is recorded. andas a full set of figures is needed for the calculations thatfollow I have interpolated. approximately linearly. insuch cases. The interpolated figures are in italics in Tab.1.Skokholm is a most important station for sea-birdpopulations. Throughout the years there have beenthousands of pairs of Manx shearwater Puffinus puffinus.storm petrel Hydrobates pelagicus. and puffinsFratercula arctica. and these are the largest colonies.along with those on the neighbouring island of Skomer.in the Celtic Sea (Cramp et al. 1974). Herring gullsLarus argentatus and lesser black-backed gulls Larusfuscus have increased from hundreds of pairs pre-war tothousands now. There are also hundreds of pairs ofrazorbills Alca torda and guillemots Uria aalge. Thegreat black-backed gull Larus marinus population iscontrolled at around ten pairs. The fulmar Fulmarusglacialis first bred in 1967 and even now occupies lessthan twenty sites. There have been casual records ofbreeding of shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis and kittiwakeRissa tridactyla (Lockley 1969). There have also beenthirty to forty pairs of rock pipits Anthus spinolettabreeding on the cliffs each year. Lack (1969) did notregard them as land-birds. and I have. somewhat reluctantly.followed him. partly because the estimates ofpopulation size are even rougher than those of themeadow pipit A. pratensis.MethodsMany features of the data can be brought out by simplemethods (Williamson 1981). However. to produce asatisfactory ordination of both species and years is notso simple. and requires a consideration both of differentordination methods. and of whether the data should betransformed.For most biological populations a transformation tothe logarithm of the numbers is desirable (Williamson1972a). When there are many zeros. as in Tab. 1. log(n+1) or better the arc-sinh transformation. which islog (n+(n2+ 1)12). can be used (Williamson 1981). butthese small numbers show features of a Poisson distribution.s o a square root transformation may be desirable(Pollard 1977). Tukey (1977) gives methods fordetermining an appropriate power transformation.which he refers to as re-expression. (with the logarithmbeing equivalent to a zero power). It is well-known thata plot of the logarithm of the mean against thelogarithm of the variance may indicate that a transformation is needed. When the variance is proportional tothe mean. a square root transformation is indicated; thestandard deviation proportional to the mean indicates alogarithmic transformation. Taylor et al. (1978) givemany examples of such plots showing clearly. to mymind. that most biological data needs transformationand usually something. on Tukey's scale. bounded bythe square root and the logarithm.These tests on the data of years in Tab. 1. both includingand excluding zeros. point to a square roottransformation. By species. again with and withoutzeros. the results are more variable. which is not surprising.The raven population is almost constant at onepair. The stock dove Columba oenas and jackdaw Corvusmonedula populations vary from zero to sixty pairs.In view of this scatter.although a logarithmic transformationwould be better for the common species. asquare root transformation is justifiable for all. and sohas been used.A standard Principal Component Analysis of datawith many zeros usually produces a curved result. thehorseshoe effect. from artificial data designed to belinear (Williamson 1978). Various methods have beenproposed to prevent this including multi-dimensionalscaling. MDS (Carroll and Arabie 1980). reciprocal averaging(or contingency analysis). and Hill's developmentof it. Decorana (Gauch 1982). and the step-acrossmethod (Williamson 1978). Reciprocal averaging andstep-across are direct; multi-dimensional scaling isiterative. and requires a variety of starting configurations.Decorana assumes the second Principal axis to bean artefact. and reduces it by a slicing technique.Step-across applies only to incidence matrices. whereall the entries are one of zero. Much of the variation inTab. 1 and similar data occurs in the number of entitiespresent. The similarity index used in step-across is theJaccard one. the number of joint occurrences. Thenatural extension of this to continuous data is illustratedin Fig. 2. It is the total set of joint occurrences. the areaof the intersection of the species graphs. Mathematically.this is Kendall's (1971) circle product. I min (a.b). The effect of using the circle product on species withmoderate overlap is to make them more similar than ifthe Jaccard index is used. so tending to re-create ahorseshoe. This can be corrected by a transformation;the square root of the circle product has been used here.This development of step-across can be called stepalongfor convenience.English (1982) compared MDS. Decorana andstep-along analyses of both the Eastern Wood (Williamson1981) data and a sub-set of the Skokholm data.using years in which complete records exist. Not allvariants of MDS are available at York. but he foundthose that were very expensive in computer time. requiring arbitrary choices of starting point. and the resultsdisappointing. Decorana produced the straightesttime axis. but. as will be seen. the time axis at Skokholmshould be curved. So the method has had the unfortunateeffect of removing. as an artefact. a real feature.The species ordination by Decorana was not readily interpretable.Consequently. the remainder of this paperdeals only with step-along results. The transformationsused here. of square roots for both data and circle product.are not critical.

In 1952 inmixed prairie near Redvers. Saskatchewan. and in 1953in aspen-parkland near Lousana. Alberta (Fig. 1). theUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service undertookyearly collections of waterfowl census and habitat dataon 0.2 km wide. permanently established transects. TheRedvers Waterfowl Study Area was a reversed-L transect.each arm roughly 32.2 km long; the total areawas 12.9 km2. The terrain was gently rolling and reliefgenerally <3 m. The pothole basins were generallysaucer shaped rather than bowl shaped (Stoudt 1971).The Lousana Waterfowl Study Area was a rectangulartransect roughly 16.1 x 6.4 km. or 9.3 km2. The terrainwas knob-and-kettle-like. A larger percentage ofponds at Lousana. compared with Redvers (45 vs.31%). were classified as permanent (Smith 1971).Each pothole on the transects was numbered andvisited several times yearly when breeding pairs of allspecies were counted. Dzubin (1969a) provided a reviewof the potential biases in transect-collected censusdata for ducks. Violations of these assumptionspose problems for deterministic calculations; the valuein these data is that. while they may be crude by thosestandards. the amount of data and the time span theycover outweigh disadvantages imposed by the mannerof data collection. Two assumptions. for purposes ofthis analysis. are important: first. the relative populationsizes of ducks were as the observers recordedthem. and second. proportional use of different pondtypes by different species was represented by the censusdata. The second assumption is made more plausibleby validation of the first; the first is reasonablebecause considerable effort was made to census allponds thoroughly (Smith 1971:14. Stoudt 1971:14). Onebiologist collected most of the data. although in recentyears. other United States Fish and Wildlife Servicepersonnel and I collected data.Each pothole was scored for each of the followingcharacteristics: permanence classification. size.depth. degree of openness of surrounding vegetation.percent coverage of pond surface by emergentvegetation. and type of vegetation. All values of habitatvariables were of ordinal level; type of vegetationwas not a nominal-level variable because it tookon values that corresponded to structural complexity(height. density) of each plant type or association.Twenty-six years of data (1952-1977) from Redverswere available for analysis. Four censuses were conductedyearly from 1952 to 1965; commencement datesof censuses varied between 1-11 May. 1-4 June. 29June-13 July. and 22-26 July. Eight and six censuseswere conducted in the drought years 1961 and 1962.respectively. After 1965. one July census was begunbetween 11 and 23 July; dates of May and June censusesvaried as in previous years. Nine years (1968-1976) of data from the Lousana area were availablefor analysis.

The method makes useof concepts from distance sampling. i.e.. point countsor line-intercept techniques. The method makes noattempts to model capture-history data. therefore it wasnot necessary to follow individuals through time(between sessions). Distance sampling methods allow forsighting or detection (capture) probabilities todecrease with increasing distance from the point orline. The modeling of detection probability as afunction of distance forms the basis for estimation.Trapping webs were designed to provide a gradient ofcapture probabilities. decreasing with distance from theweb center. Density estimation from the trapping web wasbased on three assumptions:1. All animals located at the center of the webwere caught with probability 1.0;2. Individuals did not move preferentially towardor away from the web center;3. Distances from the web center to each trapstation were measured accurately.Each web consisted of 12 trap lines radiating around acenter station. each line with 12 permanently-markedtrap stations. In order to increase the odds ofcapturing any animals inhabiting the center of a web.the center station had four traps. each pointing in acardinal direction. and the first four stations of eachtrap line were spaced only 5 m apart. providing a trapsaturation effect. The remaining eight stations in atrap line were spaced at 10 m intervals. The web thusestablished a series of concentric rings of traps. Trapsin the ring nearest the web center are close together.while the distances separating traps that form aparticular ring increase with increasing distance of thering from the web center. The idea is that the webconfiguration produces a gradient in trap density and.therefore. in the probability of capture. Three randomlydistributed trapping webs were constructed at each site.The perimeters of webs were placed at least 100 m apartin order to minimize homerange overlap for individualscaptured in the outer portion of neighboring webs.Measurement TechniquesEach site containing three webs was sampled for threeconsecutive nights during spring (in mid May or earlyJune) and summer (in mid July or early August for years1989 to 1993. then mid September to early October foryears 1994 through 2000). In that rodent populationswere not sampled monthly over the study period. there isno certainly that either spring or summer trapping timesactually captured annual population highs or lows. Basedon reproductive data in the literature. an assumptionwas made that sampling times chosen represent periods ofthe year when rodents have undergone. and wouldregister. significant seasonal change in density.During each trapping session. one Sherman live trap(model XLF15 or SFAL. H. B. Sherman Traps. Tallahassee.FL) was placed. baited with rolled oats. and set at eachpermanent. numbered station (four in the center) on eachweb. for a total 444 traps over three webs. Traps werechecked at dawn each day. closed during the day. andreset just before dusk. Habitat. trap station number.species. sex. age (adult or juvenile). mass. bodymeasurements (total length. tail length. hind footlength. ear length). and reproductive condition (males:scrotal or non-scrotal; females: lactating. vaginal orpregnant) were recorded for each initial capture of anindividual. Each animal was marked on the belly with apermanent ink felt pen in order to distinguish it fromother individuals during the same trapping session. Thetrap station number for an initial capture related to aparticular trapping ring on a web and. therefore. to aparticular distance from the center of the web. The areasampled by a ring of traps was computed based oncircular zones whose limits are defined by pointshalfway between adjacent traps along trap lines; anadditional 25 m radius was added to the outer ring oftraps in order to account for homerange size ofindividuals caught on the outer ring.Analytical ProceduresArea trapped and number of individuals caught for eachring of traps was the basis for estimating theprobability density function of the area sampled. Theprogram DISTANCE produced the estimators used tocalculate density. Where sample size for a particularspecies and web was less than an arbitrarily chosenn=10. the number of individuals captured during thatsession was simply divided into the area of the web plusthe additional 25 m radius (4.9087 ha).

Site descriptionWithin the 20 ha study area there are 24 experimental plots. Each plot has anarea of 0.25 ha and is fenced to regulate rodent access to the plot. Access is regulated using gatescut into the fencing. Large gates (3.7 ? 5.7 cm) allow all small mammals to access plots. Smallgates (1.9 ? 1.9 cm) exclude kangaroo rats (Dipodomys) whose inflated auditory bullae make theirskulls too large to pass through the gates. Rodent removal plots do not contain any gates andanimals caught on those plots are removed and released outside the cattle exclosure fence.On each plot there are 49 permanent trapping stations marked by rebar stakes forming a 7 ? 7 grid.Every stake on a plot has a unique identifying number denoting the coordinate of that stake on thatplot. For example. stake 11 is the first stake on the first row. Rows are numbered 1 through 7going from the most northern row to the most southern. Columns are numbered 1 through 7 goingfrom the most western column to the most eastern (See metadata.htm. Fig. 1).Treatments: See metadata.htm. Table 1. for details on treatment assignments for each plot.Data Collection Period. Frequency: From 1977?2002. plots were trapped around each newmoon ? which occurs approximately once a month. though occasionally blue moons do occur.resulting in 2 separate surveys in a month. Occasionally. months are missed. Months that areentirely missed are not noted in the database. Sometimes weather or other unforeseen occurrencesprevent the complete trapping of a survey. these are noted in the database (see Table 1 below).3. Research MethodsField: The site is surveyed for rodents approximately once each month. The survey occurs asclose to the new moon as possible to minimize external effects on trapping success which could bemisconstrued as actual changes in populations. During a survey. each plot is trapped for one nightwith treatments divided evenly between nights to eliminate differences between controls andtreatments caused by environmental differences on different nights. When a plot is surveyed. allgates are closed to ensure that only resident individuals are captured. At each stake. one Shermanlive-trap is placed and baited with millet seed. Traps are collected the next morning andindividuals processed. Each individual was tagged and data on species. location caught (plot andstake). sex. reproductive condition. weight. and hindfoot length were recorded. Until 1993.individuals were tagged using either ear tags or toe tags. After 1993. individuals werepredominately tagged using Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tags.

Until substantial poaching began in 1986. Manyara had the highest mammalian biomass density in any natural ecosystem (Delany and Happold 1979; Drent and Prins 1987). comparable to the system of Queen Elizabeth National Park. Uganda (again dominated by elephant and buffalo) before severe poaching reduced mammal numbers drastically there in the 1970s. Manyara is situated mainly in the Eastern Rift Valley (960 m above sea level) but partly on the Mbulu Plateau (1600 m a.s.l.) and receives an average of 650 mm of rain annually. Most game in the Park is sedentary but wildebeest and Burchell's zebra show extensive migratory movements into the rest of the Masai Ecosystem (Prins 1987). Estimates were obtained from a variety of sources (see Legend of Table 1) of the total number of large herbivores (heavier than 20 kg) within the present Park boundaries during the last 25 years. The species and nomenclature are present in Table 2. Where data were lacking for a particular species for a given year of census. estimates were made on the basis of figures from the previous and subsequent censuses. The obtained estimates were discussed with park rangers who had been working in the Park at the time of the missing value. Published figures (Table 1) were also discussed with these rangers. and on the basis of these and on the warden's reports (1959 through 1973). the published figures for the hippopotamus population in 1961. 1965. 1967. and 1970 were disregarded and a new estimate was used instead. It should be noted that estimates of bush species (viz. black rhinoceros. bushbuck. and to a lesser extent impala. waterbuck. and olive baboon) because of the limited visibility in their habitat. are undoubtedly less reliable than estimates for plains species (viz. Burchell's zebra. wildebeest. and to a lesser degree warthog) or for other large herbivores (African elephant. Cape buffalo. and giraffe; cf. Prins and Weyer-haeuser 1987). The estimates for reedbuck are quite reliable as the wardens paid special attention to their numbers. Consumption was calculated according to the assumption that the herbivores' daily food intake (dry matter) equals 2.5% of their live body weight (Crampton and Harris 1969; Van Soest 1982. Van Wijngaarden 1985). which compares reasonably well with the published data for food intake of East African herbivores (Delany and Happold 1979). For the calculations the average live weights used for the different species are presented in Table 2. Some of the species in Manyara are considered real grazers. others real browsers but many species are mixed feeders (Hofmann 1973). As we are interested in quantifying the consumption of grass and browse in Manyara. the consumption by species falling in the category mixed feeder had to be divided into grass consumption and browse consumption. For this division we used the data from Table 2. The data we present are gross indices of consumption per unit land in the Park. The acreage of the dry land area of the park has varied over time because of changes in the level of Lake Manyara. After periods of heavy rainfall the lake submerged parts of the grasslands and woodlands but during extended droughts the lake receded after which the surfacing shore was again colonized by grasses (Loth and Prins 1986. Prins and Loth 1988). The real land area of the Park in the different census years as calculated from aerial photographs (Loth and Prins 1986) is presented in Table 1. The pressure exerted on the vegetation by the herbivores is assumed to be equal to their consumption. although this ignores the effects of trampling. which can be quite important (cf. Sinclair and Norton-Griffiths 1979). Five groups of herbivores are distinguished in the analyses. viz. buffalo elephant-as-grazer. elephant-as-browser'. other grazers (i.e. hippopotamus. Burchell's zebra. wildebeest. impala. reedbuck. waterbuck. warthog. baboon. and bushbuck) and other browsers (i.e. giraffe. black rhinoceros. baboon. impala. bush- buck. waterbuck. reedbuck. and warthog); the categories are weighted according to body weight and the proportions grass or browse in the diet (Table 2). Mean-square successive difference testing was used to detect whether a time series was randomly distributed around the mean. or not (Wonnacott and Wonnacott 1977). The constancy parameter s. defined as the standard deviation of the base-10 logarithm of population estimates. was used to assess the stability of the population; when s is smaller than approximately 0.3 the population is considered stable (Ostfeld 1988). It is. however. better to speak of constancy (i.e.. lack of change in a numerical parameter) than of stability. as the latter implies that the population returns to a certain state after disturbance (Orians 1975). For the species assemblage we calculated a stability index. following McNaughton (1978). Thus. we defined n as the number of herbivore species (n = 13). i as the interaction term equalling the mean value of significant Spearman rank correlation coefficients (rj) between population numbers (for P<0.05 and for P< 0.01). and c the proportion of all r. values that were significant. The stability index is calculated as i/(nc) 1/2; when the stability index is < 1.0. the system is stable and when the index is > 1.0. the system is not stable. We did not calculate guild size (nc) (McNaughton 1978). as this does not appear to be a valid calculation (Harris 1979; Lawton and Ralliston 1979).” Large mammals census in Park in Tanzania Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",Census,1.

Surveys were conducted between 04:30 and 08:00 EDT and most were completed by 06:30 EDT. Observers listened quietly for ten minutes at each of five stations. [In 2003 we increased the 5-species point count length from five to ten minutes in order to gather more information and to achieve methodological consistency with the all-species protocols and with Canada?s High-Elevation Landbird Program.]They recorded the number of each focal species seen or heard during three time periods: 0-3 minutes 3-5 minutes and 5-10 minutes. If Bicknell?s Thrush was not detected during or between point counts surveyors returned to each point immediately after the full route survey and broadcast a one-minute recording of the bird?s vocalizations in order to elicit a response from present but silent birds. A two-minute listening period followed each broadcast. [Prior to 2003 the broadcast duration was three minutes.]Audio playbacks were discontinued upon detection of one or more individuals. If no Bicknell?s Thrush responded to the broadcasts the status of the species at that location was classified as unknown. Monitors who completed their surveys without encountering Bicknell?sThrush were asked to conduct follow-up audio playback surveys at dusk or dawn before 15 July (after Atwood et al. 1996). If no observations of Bicknell?s Thrush were made during the second visit the species was presumed to be absent from that site. Site selection was based on a GIS model of potential Bicknell?s Thrush habitat that incorporates elevation. latitude. and forest type (see Lambert et al. 2005). The model depicts conifer-dominated forests above an elevation threshold that drops 81.63 m for every one-degree increase in latitude (-81.63 m/1? latitude). The threshold?s slope corresponds closely with the latitude-elevation relationship for treeline in the Appalachian Mountain chain. which is -83 m/1? latitude (Cogbill and White 1991). Four routes have been established on peaks lying below the elevation threshold. while forty routes cross the threshold due to the limited availability of trails or land area above the threshold. We made an attempt to randomize site selection by randomly assigning priority ranks to discrete units of high-elevation habitat. However. the choice of sites was constrained by the availability of volunteers and the location of existing trails. When placing routes. we favored discrete starting points (e.g. trail junction). extensive conifer stands. and upper elevations. Volunteers establishing a route for the first time placed five points at 200- to 250-m intervals along a mapped course. Monitors submitted a detailed description of each station in order to facilitate its location in future years. 10% quinaldine solution spread throughout the study site to anesthertize fish.

(1994) was applied also during the additional seventeen years. For a recent general description and discussion of the method we refer to Bibby et al. (2000). The method is also called spot mapping? after William (1936) and it is similar to the method used in the Common Bird Census in the UK (Marchant et al. 1990) and the Breeding Bird Census in North America (Robbins 1970). The observer walks slowly through the plot putting down all bird observations in their proper positions on a map paying particular attention to recording simultaneous presence of males in adjacent territories. Species maps are then constructed from the visit map records. The species maps are used to evaluate the number of distinct clusters of records which are believed to represent territories. The method is of course prone to errors both when recording the birds in the field and when evaluating the number of territories from the species maps. Furthermore the number of territories is never stable throughout the breeding season: some birds die some fail to breed successfully and leave their territories and some arrive late and establish new territories. However for our analysis it is not essential to know the exact number of territories in every particular part of every breeding season. Instead standardization (recording birds and evaluating the species maps in the same way every year) is the key to reliable comparisons and we did our best to achieve this. We made ten visits per year in all but two years (nine visits in 2007 and 2009). They were distributed from April through June (always after 9 April and before 18 June) but with variation according to the arrival of spring. All surveys were made by the same person one of the authors (Ann Mari Thorner). Since AMT also carried out all surveys in 1987?1992 there is now a series of no less than twenty-one years with the same observer. This ensures that the new results are comparable with the data from before 1993. Each visit took between two and three hours so the minimum annual survey effort was twenty hours. A cluster of records was accepted as a territory if it contained at least three records (for a few very late arriving species two records was considered sufficient; cf. Svensson 1978). Adjacent clusters were accepted as different territories either if they were distant enough from each other (in relation to typical territory size) to make it likely that they belonged to different males or if they contained simultaneous records (a male recorded in both at the same time). A special study on inter-specific competition with a large number of nest-boxes was conducted in the valley in 1963?1966 (Enemar et al. 1972). The populations of Great Tit Blue Tit and Pied Flycatcher were artificially enhanced these years. We removed the effect of the experiment by reducing the numbers to a proportion equal to the mean proportion in the four years before and the four years after the experiment. The number of Great Tits was reduced from 9 10 19 16 pairs to 6 6 12 10 respectively. The number of Blue Tits was reduced from 6 4 7 5 pairs to 3 2 4 3 pairs. The number of Pied Flycatchers was reduced from 15 18 18 13 pairs to 4 5 5 4 pairs. These modified values are used in all calculations in this paper. Species turnover rate between two different years was calculated by dividing the total of new and lost species with the number of species in year one plus the number of species in year two. This gives the value one hundred percent (that is complete) turnover when no species are common between the two compared years. This is different from the turnover calculation by Enemar et al. (1994) where the sum of new and lost species was divided by the mean number of species in the two years. The latter method gives one hundred percent turnover when half of the species have been lost and replaced with new ones (the methods are identical in principle but give results that differ by a factor of two). In the same way we calculated turnover between two years different number of years apart (from adjacent years to a maximum of fifty-six years apart that is 1953 and 2009). Altogether forty-one small passerine species were recorded as territorial in at least one of the fifty-seven years. Eighteen of these species were keeping territories in all or almost all years (the first eighteen species in Appendix 1 also listed in 33Table 1). These eighteen species are called regular? in this paper. The final twenty-three species of Appendix 1 that is those with zero values in many or almost all years are called non-regular species. Eight of these latter species were recorded in less than four of the fifty-seven years and these species are not at all tested for population change. For the remaining fifteen non-regular and the eighteen regular species we calculated and compared the average number of territories during the first forty and the last seventeen years respectively. The difference between the two periods for the regular species was tested using a two-tailed t-test (Microsoft Excel) and the logarithms of the original values (with a small number of zeros replaced with the value 0.1 to permit calculation of logarithms). The differences for the non-regular species were tested using frequencies namely the number of years with different number of territories (i.e. with 0 1 2 3 and so forth territories). When the number of frequency classes was larger than four frequencies were pooled to form exactly four classes the same ones for both periods giving a 2?4 cell matrix. The Fisher exact test was then applied using the Vassar Stats package (home page of Vassar College Poughkeepsee NY). For the regular species we also calculated the trends across all fifty-seven years using the logarithm of abundance and standard linear regression (Microsoft Excel) also here with zeros replaced with the value 0.1. The same method was used when we calculated trends for parts of the full time series in these species. When calculating correlations between species we used the Spearman rank correlation module of STATISTICA (version 6.1; StatSoft?). All cover values are measured from the vegetation measurement frame which is 1 meter by 1 meter and partitioned into a grid of 100 10 cm by 10 cm squares. Cover is measured by counting the number of 10cm squares that are occupied by the foliage canopy of a particular plant species or by the soil disturbance leaf litter etc. Portions down to the 0.1 of a 10cm square are also measured.?

We live-trapped nocturnal rodents twice each year (spring late summer) on trapping webs in upland prairie (GRASS) and saltbush-dominated (SHRUB) habitats. Three 3.14-ha webs were established in each habitat. Each web had 124 Sherman traps which were spaced 10-m apart on 12 100-m spokes with 30 degrees between spokes. Four traps were set in the center of the web. Traps were set for four consecutive nights in each trapping session. Traps are baited with a mix of peanut butter and oats set in the evening and checked (and closed) at dawn. We recorded sex age and weight upon first capture of all individuals. In the early years of the study individuals were batch-marked (Sharpie colored felt markers) to distinguish recaptures from new individuals providing the minimum information necessary to use distance-sampling methods to estimate density. Most nocturnal species are now usually marked with aluminum ear tags although we continue to mark very small (pocket mice) or small-eared (voles) species only with felt pens. For ear-tagged animals we distinguish new captures (N) from individuals marked during previous sessions (old O) versus those that are recaptured (R) on 2nd 3rd or 4th nights of a trapping session. The location of one trapping web was changed from 13NE (1994-1997) to 13SW (1998- present) because of concerns about intensive cattle use in the pasture as well as activity of CPER Site Manager?s cats. bird abundance calculated from annual censuses on 4 similar transects and bird abundance per km^2 exprapolated from these counts  Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",censuses,rows with spp names of . or  were removed.

Kartzinel,,tylerk@princeton.edu,,CC-by,http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E095/064/metadata.php,Ecology,"Beginning in 2008 a series of three herbivory treatments and a control were randomly assigned to contiguous 1-ha plots replicated three times at each of three sites along a rainfall gradient (36 total plots). Any field experiment entails a trade-off between plot size and replication. Plot sizes of 1 ha are larger than those in many prior large-herbivore-exclusion studies and enabled us to include nine replicates of each plot type which was necessary both to sample multiple sites along the rainfall gradient and to achieve adequate statistical power. And although 1 ha is not large enough to detect all ecological effects of LMH (e.g. seed dispersal numerical responses of smaller LMH to the exclusion of larger LMH) it is adequate to document strong and consistent effects in many individual- population- and community-level responses of plants and small mammals (Goheen et al. 2013) as well as behavioral (as opposed to numerical) responses of smaller LMH to the exclusion of larger LMH (e.g. Young et al. 2005). Total exclosures exclude all large mammalian herbivores (LMH) larger than ~5 kg and ~50-cm tall but are accessible to hares and other small mammals; these exclosures use 2.4-m high fences consisting of 14 strands of wire electrically charged by solar powered batteries with a 1-m tall barrier consisting of 10-cm chain link. Mesoherbivore exclosures consist of 11 wires beginning 30-cm above the ground allowing access to only the smallest LMH (dik-dik Madoqua cavendishi and warthog Phacochoerus africanus) and excluding larger species. Megaherbivore exclosures consist of two wires 2-m above ground level and exclude only megaherbivores (elephants Loxodonta africana and giraffes Giraffa camelopardalis). Open? plots are unfenced and demarcated by a series of 1-m tall wooden posts at 10-m intervals; these plots allow access to all LMH species. On all fences a series of 1-m long wires at 2-m height extend horizontally outward from plots to deter animals that approach the barriers. In January 2009 vertical connecting wires were added to total- and mesoherbivore exclusion fences to increase security and stability. Exclosure plots are regularly inspected and maintained by project personnel. Rapid repairs are made whenever damage to the fencing is discovered. For the eight most common LMH species exclosure effectiveness ranged from 92% (for elephants) to 99% (for warthog and dik-dik; mean effectiveness for all LMH = 96%) during the first 3 years of the experiment (Goheen et al. 2013). Herdsmen for Mpala?s cattle-ranching operation are asked to keep cattle out of the plots. Within each plot a 0.36-ha grid (60 ? 60 m) marked by 49 rebar stakes at 10 m intervals provides a spatial template for much of the experimental monitoring. Small mammals were live trapped at two-month intervals in total-exclusion and open plots using Sherman live-traps (Goheen et al. 2013). In each trapping session and for four consecutive days a single trap was set at each of the 49 grid stakes in the center of each plot opened in the late afternoon and checked and closed in the early morning. All species of small mammals were fit with two fingerling ear tags with the exceptions of individuals in the genera Acomys Crocidura and Mus. These genera are too small or too fragile (Seifert et al. 2012) for ear tags; we instead marked individuals in these genera with black marker for subsequent identification within trapping sessions.

Survey number of times: Based on the record of 10 surveys of the past to the Ministry of the Environment shorebirds population fluctuation monitoring survey conducted in the (1999 to 2002) site type has been selected by the following criteria: In the core site species in order to grasp the maximum number of each time more accurately perform three or more times per survey period. In other general site but three or more of research is desirable if difficult it may be a one-time survey. Selection criteria of core site 1 - Ramsar wetlands in the registration or the East Asia and Australia that are participating in the regional shorebirds important habitat network. 2 - that you meet the Ramsar criteria (Appendix ?). 3 - East Asia and Australia that the entry criteria of local shorebirds important habitat network is more than more meets. 4 - countries designated wildlife sanctuary or that has been designated as an important wetland 500. 5- is that track record that provided the data to the investigation of the national level. Record: In each study site counting start time and end time of the survey in the paper ( fill in the time close to the investigation time band) low tide time and high tide time to record the number of individual species of interest in the investigation range . In addition survey sites name study area code study site location to fill the investigator name. Each investigator is most of the selected the time zone in which the number of individuals can be counted to conduct a survey. Therefore in an environment where a tide such as tidal flats estuaries band investigation time is not matter whether it is at the time or low tide is at high tide.Aggregation of simultaneous investigation: The survey was conducted before and after 1 week (15 days) of simultaneous survey date and simultaneous investigation. Simultaneous investigation other than the survey date set to the time a lot of number of individuals in the study period. Spring and fall and winter of each one but is set to be carried out an investigation on the same day across the country this is by carrying out the count in the period in which to concentrate as much as possible snipes plovers that are brought over to Japan as a whole at some point in time Ru Dare to understand the majority of the total number of individuals of the kind. If we study all at once survey date it prevents the result by counting duplicate the same herd in a different place leading to the understanding of a more exact number of individuals . In particular in close proximity to the region study the combined date and time is desirable.Than shorebirds of observation record in the maximum number of counting each study site the maximum number of the things that was extracted the largest number for each species. This the maximum number of the investigation period by the (spring autumn winter) aggregated to to understand the seasonal changes and the annual change of the tri- state in each study site.

Each site was sampled for 7<96>8 complete nights over the 2-year period, with a minimum time interval of 30 days between netting nights. All sites were sampled with equal effort during all moon phases, and we generally avoided netting immediately before and after a full moon in order to minimize potential bias in capture success as a result of lunar-phobic behaviour (e.g. Morrison, 1978). During each survey night, we used six nets erected at ground level and spaced c. 50 m apart. In order also to sample bats flying in higher forest strata, we set up a net wall, typically consisting of four stacked nets, reaching subcanopy (mainland sites) or canopy (islands) level. Canopy height across study sites averaged < 20 m and was often < 15 m on islands. Species were identified, and standard measurements and demographic data were collected following Handley et al. (1991). Nomenclature follows Simmons (2005). Most bats (species > 10 g, excluding juveniles) were marked with individually numbered ball-chain necklaces, or, in the case of larger gleaning animalivores, with passive, subcutaneous transponders (EURO-ID, Weilerswist, Germany). Based on the classification system used by several authors (Stevens & Willig, 2000; Patterson et al., 2003; Giannini & Kalko, 2004, 2005), we assigned bats to one of the following ensembles (Fauth et al., 1996): frugivores, gleaning animalivores, nectarivores, omnivores, and sanguivores.

For each site, we assessed vegetation structure (local-scale variable) and, for five focal scales, quantified habitat amount and four landscape configuration metrics. Each sampling site was visited eight times over a 2-year period, between August 2011 and June 2013. Bats were captured using 14 ground-level mist nets (12 9 2.5 m, 16 mm mesh, ECOTONE, Poland) in CF and fragment interiors, and seven ground-level mist nets at the edge and matrix sites. Mist nets were deployed along existing trails which are known to be used by Neotropical bats as commuting flyways (Palmeirim and Etheridge 1985). At edge sites, these trails ran parallel to the border between primary forest and secondary regrowth. In our study area mist netting efficiency was found to be highest in the first few hours after sunset (Bernard 2002). Sampling therefore started at dusk and was performed for 6 h during which nets were visited at intervals of*20 min. Mist netting at the same location for consecutive days can lead to diminishing capture efficiency over time (Marques et al. 2013). Such net-shyness related bias was avoided by spacing visits to the same site 3<96>4 weeks apart. Species were identified following Gardner (2007) and Lim and Engstrom (2010), and taxonomy follows Gardner (2007). Most adult bats were marked with individually numbered ball-chain necklaces (frugivores and Pteronotus parnellii) or subcutaneous transponders (gleaning animalivores). We restricted analyses to phyllostomids and P. parnellii, since all other species in Neotropical bat assemblages are known to be inadequately sampled with mist-nets (Kalko 1998).
